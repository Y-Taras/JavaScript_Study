/*
Challenge:
Have the function OfflineMinimum take the StrArr parameter being
passed which will be an array of integers raning from ...n and the
letter 'E' and return the subset based on the following rules. The
StrArr will be formatted as [i,i,i,E,i,E] where i stands for an 
integer and 'E' stands for the letter E. Whenever the value of an
index is E, return the lowest integer in the array. For example, 
if StrArr is ["5","4","6","E","1","7","E","E","3","2"] it should 
return 4,1,5.

alert(OffLineMinimum(["5","4","6","E","1","7","E","E","3","2"])); // 4,1,5
