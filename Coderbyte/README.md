###Why Coderbyte?
 * Practice my JavaScript skills.
 * Practice my problem solving skills.
 * It's fun.
 * Helpful for tech bootcamp interviews.

###My Process:
  * Do the challenges.
  
  * Helpful resources(when stuck):    
   * [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/)    
   * [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
   * [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
       
  * Lastly, if after going through these resources I still cannot figure out do the following steps:
    * Take a coffee/meal/snake/exercise break.
    * Think about problem during break.
    
  * If still cannot figure out, look for hints from other users who have completed the problem.
    * NO COPY AND PASTING! Seriously, what's the point?
    * Read, analyze, and learn something new so you understand how they solved it.
    * Next time you can use this new knowledge for another problem! :)
